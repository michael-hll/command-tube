    # ** Usage **
    # We can use tube variable to condition exec our tube commands
    # For this example, there are two tube variables: build_bl and build_ui 
    # Then from the terminal console, we can use below command to only build bL:
    # >>> tube -y Sample-conditional-build.yaml -f -v build_bl=yes
    # We can use below command to build ui only:
    # >>> tube -y Sample-conditional-build.yaml -f -v build_ui=yes
    # Or we can build both bl and ui:
    # >>> tube -y Sample-conditional-build.yaml -f -v build_bl=yes build_ui=yes
